/**
 * Register the `/plugin/<pluginKey>/*` reverse proxy.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 *
 * Upstream resolution: per-request, using `findPluginByKey` against the DB.
 * The plugin row must exist and `status === 'active'`. The `enabled` flag is
 * intentionally ignored here — `enabled` gates Discord command/event dispatch,
 * NOT the plugin's own HTTP surface; an admin may want to view a disabled
 * plugin's WebUI without re-enabling its Discord commands.
 *
 * Auth: /plugin/* is intentionally NOT behind the bot's admin auth hook.
 * The plugin does its own `plugin-session` JWT check; the Discord `?token=`
 * link lands here without a bot login session and must reach the plugin
 * server as-is. The global onRequest hook in server.ts only gates `/api/*`,
 * so /plugin/* is already unguarded at the hook level.
 *
 * Proxy approach: hand-rolled `server.all` + `@fastify/reply-from`. The
 * `@fastify/http-proxy` `getUpstream` option would be cleaner but requires
 * the upstream to be deterministic at plugin-register time. Here we need a
 * per-request async DB lookup, which `reply.from()` supports naturally when
 * called manually inside a route handler.
 *
 * Helmet / CSP: @fastify/helmet is wrapped with fastify-plugin so its
 * onRequest hooks propagate to the entire root scope, including /plugin/*.
 * Helmet's security headers (including Content-Security-Policy) ARE applied
 * to every /plugin/* response. However, @fastify/reply-from copies the
 * upstream response headers (including any CSP the upstream sends) back to
 * the client — when the upstream sends a CSP header it overwrites helmet's.
 * Plugin WebUIs MUST therefore send their own Content-Security-Policy; a
 * plugin that sends no CSP will be served with the bot's strict default CSP,
 * which will block most inline scripts and styles.
 *
 * Body / multipart: the proxy is registered inside an encapsulated scope
 * (see server.ts — `server.register(async (instance) => { registerPluginProxy(instance) })`).
 * A catch-all content-type parser (`'*'`) is registered on that encapsulated
 * instance, so the globally-registered @fastify/multipart parser (which
 * consumes multipart/form-data bodies and would otherwise empty them before
 * the proxy could forward them) is overridden within the proxy scope only.
 * Bodies are buffered as Buffer before forwarding — safe for the proxy's
 * upload payloads (radio cover-art is <=25 MiB, already enforced by the
 * bodyLimit Fastify option). The root scope's @fastify/multipart is
 * unaffected and continues to parse multipart bodies for /api/* routes.
 *
 * SSRF: the upstream URL is re-vetted via `assertPluginTarget()` on every
 * proxied request, mirroring the per-call pattern used in
 * plugin-interaction-dispatch.service.ts and plugin-event-bridge.service.ts.
 * This prevents a plugin operator from repointing the plugin's DNS after
 * registration to redirect the anonymous-accessible proxy to an internal
 * target. On policy violation the proxy returns 502 and does not connect.
 *
 * Header hygiene: hop-by-hop and sensitive forwarding headers are stripped
 * and replaced with canonical values before the request is forwarded. Any
 * set-cookie headers in the upstream response have their Path rewritten to
 * the plugin's proxy prefix and their Domain attribute stripped, so a plugin
 * cannot set cookies on the bot's root domain.
 *
 * SSE / WebSocket: long-lived text/event-stream responses will hit the
 * 30-second upstream timeout and be dropped. WebSocket Upgrade requests are
 * not proxied by @fastify/reply-from — a future plugin needing real-time
 * transport would require the proxy to be extended.
